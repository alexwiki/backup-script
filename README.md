# backup script
A Bash script aimed to automate compression and backup of various files. 
maybe later stuff:
password compression(?) or even encryption (gpg)
remote sync (rsync) / local or a good idea is to implement onedrive integration
and last but not least unzip script. (work in progress)

Currently supported algorithms:
lz4, zstd, zip,bzip2
